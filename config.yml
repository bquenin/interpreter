# Refresh rate in seconds (how often to capture and process the screen)
# Lower = more responsive but higher CPU usage. With local models:
# - Capture: ~50-65ms, OCR: ~35-60ms, Translation: ~125-335ms
# - Recommended: 0.5s (fast CPU) to 1.0s (slower CPU)
refresh_rate: 0.5

# OCR confidence threshold (0.0-1.0)
# Filters out garbage text by average per-line confidence.
# Example: "D(0.32) p(0.59) → avg: 0.45" would be dropped with threshold 0.6
#          "こ(0.93) ん(0.96) → avg: 0.94" would be kept
